## Teaching and Learning Methodologies

⁃ Critical reading and watching: understand what’s the intention, what’s the power structure, and unveil the hidden ideologies.
⁃ Creativity and maker mindset in a studio-class setup: take apart and repurpose, draft, design, and build.
⁃ Presentation and discussion: Classes include prepared short presentations by students and discussions on the readings and other assigned material.

## Grades and Rubrics

10% Participation: Active contribution to the discussions, showing initiative, taking on tasks outside the assignments.
30% Assignments: Preparedness (having actually read/watched the material), timely submission of assignments, quality of work (see rubrics), presenting in class.
30% - Midterm project
30% - Final project

### Rubrics

20% Comprehension (understanding of the material, structure, argumentation)
30% Criticism (assessing the form, intention, preliminary conditions of the assigned material; questioning the arguments), resp. technical complexity for programming assignments
50% Creativity (Showing original thoughts and ideas; compelling form of presentation; creative use of various techniques with focus on interactive media; aesthetics of the experience)

### Assignments will be graded according to the following scale of 100%

- Poor	Evinced poor absorption of material, or made no effort (0-70%)
- Adequate	Accomplished enough to prove the student encountered the material (71-80%)
- Good	Demonstrated strong effort incorporating and articulating concepts in a creative way (81-90%)
- Excellent	Exceptional creativity, understanding and synthesis of the material (91-100%)

## Attendance and Participation

- Attendance is mandatory. Unexcused absences or habitual lateness will negatively impact your grade for the class. Being late for more than 15 minutes with no excuse will count as an unexcused absence. Two unexcused absences will result in a decrease in your overall final grade (i.e. B+ to B). Three will result in an entire letter grade drop (i.e. from A to B). Four will result in two letter grade drops (i.e. from A to C). More than four unexcused absences will result in an F.
- Engaging in the class discussion, offering feedback to peers, and being mentally present is a major part of the grade.
- Presenting work and writing in class is required, giving talks on topics is expected. 

### Social Media, Messaging, Notifications
- Absolutely no use of social media or messaging services in class - neither on phone nor on laptop except when it is the explicit topic.
- Notifications must be set to silence.

## My Availability and Office Hours

If there are any questions, need for help or further instruction, please reach out to me. You may just tell me before or after class or sign up for office hours, usually on Wednesdays.

## Accommodation and Mental Health Awareness
As a University student, you may experience a range of issues that can interfere with your ability to perform academically or impact your daily functioning, such as: heightened stress; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; sleep disturbance; strained relationships; grief and loss; personal struggles. If you have any well-being or mental health concerns please visit the Counseling Center on the ground floor of the campus center from 9am-5pm Abu Dhabi time Sunday - Thursday, or schedule an appointment to meet with a counselor by calling: +971 02-628-8100, or emailing: nyuad.healthcenter@nyu.edu. If you require mental health support outside of these hours call NYU's Wellness Exchange hotline at +971 02-628-5555, which is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You can also utilize the Wellness Exchange mobile chat feature, details of which you can find on the student portal. If you need help connecting to these supports please contact me directly. 
Diversity and inclusion are important tenets of NYUAD and my own teaching philosophy. Please let me know if you have a disability I should be aware of or require special assistance. I am happy to make accommodations.
