## Teaching and Learning Methodologies

⁃ Critical reading and watching: understand what’s the intention, what’s the power structure, and unveil the hidden ideologies.
⁃ Creativity and maker mindset in a studio-class setup: take apart and repurpose, draft, design, and build.
⁃ Presentation and discussion: Classes include prepared short presentations by students and discussions on the readings and other assigned material.
⁃ Inclusion and diversity: We will respect each other in our specific culture and personal values, we will focus on listening to everybody’s voice, in class and by focussing on material outside the mainstream.
 
## Assignments

- Reading and watching the provided material is required each week in advance.
- Assigned readings and videos will be discussed in class. Preparedness (i.e. having read/watched the assigned material), active participation, and therefore attendance to the classes will be graded.
- All assignments are to be submitted via NYU Classes. Submitting just a link is absolutely sufficient unless stated otherwise.

## Grades and Rubrics

10% Participation: Active contribution to the discussions, showing initiative, taking on tasks outside the assignments.
30% Assignments: Preparedness (having actually read/watched the material), timely submission of assignments, quality of work (see rubrics), presenting in class.
30% - Midterm project
30% - Final project

### Rubrics

20% Comprehension (understanding of the material, structure, argumentation)
30% Criticism (assessing the form, intention, preliminary conditions of the assigned material; questioning the arguments), resp. technical complexity for programming assignments
50% Creativity (Showing original thoughts and ideas; compelling form of presentation; creative use of various techniques with focus on interactive media; aesthetics of the experience)

### Assignments will be graded according to the following scale of 100%

- Poor	Evinced poor absorption of material, or made no effort (0-70%)
- Adequate	Accomplished enough to prove the student encountered the material (71-80%)
- Good	Demonstrated strong effort incorporating and articulating concepts in a creative way (81-90%)
- Excellent	Exceptional creativity, understanding and synthesis of the material (91-100%)

## Attendance and Participation

- Attendance is mandatory. Unexcused absences or habitual lateness will negatively impact your grade for the class. Being late for more than 15 minutes with no excuse will count as an unexcused absence. Two unexcused absences will result in a decrease in your overall final grade (i.e. B+ to B). Three will result in an entire letter grade drop (i.e. from A to B). Four will result in two letter grade drops (i.e. from A to C). More than four unexcused absences will result in an F.
- Engaging in the class discussion, offering feedback to peers, and being mentally present is a major part of the grade.
- Presenting work and writing in class is required, giving talks on topics is expected. 

### Social Media, Messaging, Notifications
- Absolutely no use of social media or messaging services in class - neither on phone nor on laptop except when it is the explicit topic.
- Notifications must be set to silence.
