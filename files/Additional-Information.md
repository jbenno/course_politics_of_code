## Learning Outcomes
### Course learning outcomes
1. Critical reading and watching: understand what’s the intention, what’s the power structure, and unveil the hidden ideologies.
2. Creativity and maker mindset in a studio-class setup: take apart and repurpose, draft, design, and build.
3. Presentation and discussion: Classes include prepared short presentations by students and discussions on the readings and other assigned material.
4. Inclusion and diversity: We will respect each other in our specific culture and personal values, we will focus on listening to everybody’s voice, in class and by focussing on material outside the mainstream.

## Assignments

- Reading and watching the provided material is required each week in advance.
- Assigned readings and videos will be discussed in class. Preparedness (i.e. having read/watched the assigned material), active participation, and therefore attendance to the classes will be graded.
- All assignments are to be submitted via NYU Brightspace. Submitting just a link is absolutely sufficient unless stated otherwise.
- The assignments are listed in NYU Brightspace where responses are also submitted. 
- Please note the dates and times at the link provided at the footer of the schedule pages. 

## Attendance and Participation

- Attendance is mandatory. Unexcused absences or habitual lateness might result in failing the class.
. Being late for more than 15 minutes with no excuse will count as an unexcused absence. Three or more unexcused absences will result in failing the class.
- Engaging in the class discussion, offering feedback to peers, and being mentally present is a major part of class work.
- Presenting work and writing in class is required, giving talks on topics is expected. 

### Social Media, Messaging, Notifications
- Absolutely no use of social media or messaging services in class - neither on phone nor on laptop except when it is the explicit topic.
- Notifications must be set to silence.

## My Availability and Office Hours

If there are any questions, need for help or further instruction, please reach out to me. You may just tell me before or after class or send me an email.

## Accommodation and Mental Health Awareness
As a University student, you may experience a range of issues that can interfere with your ability to perform academically or impact your daily functioning, such as: heightened stress; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; sleep disturbance; strained relationships; grief and loss; personal struggles. If you have any well-being or mental health concerns please visit the Counseling Center.

Diversity and inclusion are important tenets of NYU and my own teaching philosophy. Please let me know if you have a disability I should be aware of or require special assistance. I am happy to make accommodations.
