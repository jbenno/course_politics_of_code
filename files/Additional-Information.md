## Objectives

1. Know how digital technology is political, how it is both acting on people's lives in a political way, as well as having the potential to be a means of political processes, expression, and activism
2. Practice critical thinking and formulating critique
3. Understand how technology can be deconstructed regarding their power structures
4. Gain first skills in online publishing, application of data science tools, cyber surveillance technology and security

## Teaching Style

- Classes will be lectures, discussions, student presentations, and studio work (coding and related research)
- Recordings of the lecture part and coding instructions can be found on the course website.

## Course Material and Software

- Course website: <https://github.com/jbenno/course_politics_of_code>
- Readings will be assigned each week.
- The assigned texts will be made available online, as pdf files through the NYU library or in a designated Google drive.
- Further readings and extended material for each week and a full bibliography of all used literature can be found on the course website.
- The course will rely on open source software that is either cloud-based or can be installed on your computer. Software packages to be installed on your computer include an EDI/editor, FileZilla, Anaconda (Jupyter Notebooks).

## Participation

- This course relies on students' participation in discussions, presentations, and collaborative work in and outside class.
- You will need to bring a laptop to work in class.
- Attendance is mandatory. Please see ITP/IMA's [attendance](https://itp.nyu.edu/help/itp-ima-class-attendance-policy/) policy. Two unexcused absences will result in lowering the grade by one half.
- Being late for more than 20 minutes with no excuse will count as an unexcused absence. Three or more unexcused absences will result in failing the class.
- Engaging in the class discussion, offering feedback to peers, and being mentally present is a major part of class work.
- Presenting work and writing in class is required, giving talks on topics is expected.

### Social Media, Messaging, Notifications

- Absolutely no use of social media or messaging services in class - neither on phone nor on laptop except when it is the explicit topic.
- Notifications must be set to silence.

### Culture of Respect

- We practice a culture of collaboration and respect in class and outside class.
- Please see ITP/IMA's Code of Conduct page <https://community.itp.io/> and in particular the 'Rules of Play': <https://community.itp.io/rules_of_play>

## Assignments and Grades

- Reading and watching the provided material is required each week in advance.
- Assigned readings and videos will be discussed in class. Preparedness (i.e. having read/watched the assigned material), active participation, and therefore attendance to the classes will be graded.
- All assignments are listed in and results expected to be submitted via NYU Brightspace. Submitting just a link is absolutely sufficient unless stated otherwise.
- Please note the dates and times provided in addition to NYU Brightspace also as a Google Spreadsheet linked here and at the footer of the course website: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10sTVIMTuhJcucApQ2_A34UC9M1YQ270t3X0l6DZnmDw/edit?usp=sharing>
- Students are encouraged to give presentations in class. A presentation will usually be a talk of around 10 minutes but could also span longer when e.g. leading through code. As part of the presentation, students submit notes or slides as documentation. The presentations will receive additional points and count towards the final grade.

### Final Project

- The course will end with a final project in which you apply what we have worked on.
- Guidelines and deliverables will be worked out collectively in class at the beginning of the second half of the semester. Together we will think about what we will make and define the objectives. Examples of projects of past years include: Jointly working to improve biased or otherwise problematic Wikipedia entries, organizing a "Cryptoparty", documenting and visualizing bias and ideology in selected AI systems, â€¦
- Group work on a collaborative project is highly encouraged. Often the whole course jointly works on one project together

### Grading

- Students will receive letter grades A to F.
- Homework will be graded by submitted (2 points), submitted late (1 point), not submitted (0 points).
- Talks will be graded with a maximum of 6 points.
- The final project will be graded with a maximum of 10 points.
- Rubrics will be:
  - Form, completeness, broadness of used material 40%
  - Documentation, comments, readability 30%
