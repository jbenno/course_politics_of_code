*Deconstructing the design and implementation of software as a political medium and re-building functional alternatives.*

Code is political, as means of political processes and activism, as well as inherently by the ethical choices often hidden in the black box of *The Algorithm*.
In the course we aim to deconstruct the design, implementation, and data of software as a political medium. We will work through political applications such as simulations, urban life and the "smart city", ownership of intangible assets, predictive policing, algorithmic recommendations, suggestions, and filters, social networks, and the blockchain.

Along with an introduction to the related political theory and media studies, students will work on several hands-on projects to offer actual or speculative alternatives to the existing systems. To that end, this course will include several workshops in JavaScript, Python, and other tools.

## Teaching and Learning Methodologies

⁃ Critical reading and watching: understand what’s the intention, what’s the power structure, and unveil the hidden ideologies.
⁃ Creativity and maker mindset in a studio-class setup: take apart and repurpose, draft, design, and build.
⁃ Presentation and discussion: Classes include prepared short presentations by students and discussions on the readings and other assigned material.
⁃ Inclusion and diversity: We will respect each other in our specific culture and personal values, we will focus on listening to everybody’s voice, in class and by focussing on material outside the mainstream.
 
## Assignments

- Reading and watching the provided material is required each week in advance.
- Assigned readings and videos will be discussed in class. Preparedness (i.e. having read/watched the assigned material), active participation, and therefore attendance to the classes will be graded.
- All assignments are to be submitted via NYU Classes. Submitting just a link is absolutely sufficient unless stated otherwise.

## Grades and Rubrics

10% Participation: Active contribution to the discussions, showing initiative, taking on tasks outside the assignments.
30% Assignments: Preparedness (having actually read/watched the material), timely submission of assignments, quality of work (see rubrics), presenting in class.
30% - Midterm project
30% - Final project

### Rubrics

20% Comprehension (understanding of the material, structure, argumentation)
30% Criticism (assessing the form, intention, preliminary conditions of the assigned material; questioning the arguments), resp. technical complexity for programming assignments
50% Creativity (Showing original thoughts and ideas; compelling form of presentation; creative use of various techniques with focus on interactive media; aesthetics of the experience)

### Assignments will be graded according to the following scale of 100%

- Poor	Evinced poor absorption of material, or made no effort (0-70%)
- Adequate	Accomplished enough to prove the student encountered the material (71-80%)
- Good	Demonstrated strong effort incorporating and articulating concepts in a creative way (81-90%)
- Excellent	Exceptional creativity, understanding and synthesis of the material (91-100%)

## Attendance and Participation

- Attendance is mandatory. Unexcused absences or habitual lateness will negatively impact your grade for the class. Being late for more than 15 minutes with no excuse will count as an unexcused absence. Two unexcused absences will result in a decrease in your overall final grade (i.e. B+ to B). Three will result in an entire letter grade drop (i.e. from A to B). Four will result in two letter grade drops (i.e. from A to C). More than four unexcused absences will result in an F.
- Engaging in the class discussion, offering feedback to peers, and being mentally present is a major part of the grade.
- Presenting work and writing in class is required, giving talks on topics is expected.

### Social Media, Messaging, Notifications
- Absolutely no use of social media or messaging services in class - neither on phone nor on laptop except when it is the explicit topic.
- Notifications must be set to silence.

## My Availability and Office Hours

If there are any questions, need for help or further instruction, please reach out to me. You may just tell me before or after class or sign up for office hours, usually on Wednesdays.

## Accommodation
Diversity and inclusion are important tenets of NYUAD and my own teaching philosophy. Please let me know if you have a disability I should be aware of or require special assistance. I am happy to make accommodations.

## Academic Integrity
The mandatory policies and procedures relating to academic integrity can be found here:

- Please send me your writing or other materials via email. Links are fine, too.
- It helps if you put [Politics of Code] in front of the email subject.

## Critical Work and Documentation
### Notes
- Make notes in a sharable doc like Google Doc or on you blog/Wordpress site

### Papers
The standard writing requirement for all core courses is to write papers of formal, polished writing.

- Write clear, grammatically correct prose

- Credit and cite appropriate sources accurately according to the Chicago Manual of Style https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html

### Writing informal pieces
- 3000 to 6000 characters
- Pictures and figures are highly recommended
- Post contain links to all related sources, all documentation uses citations according to the Chicago Manual of Style https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html

### Other forms of expressions
- This is an art class. Many assignments and the projects offer different ways of creative and artistic expression. The use of creativity is highly appreciated.
- Any variety of expression might substitute an essay.
- For any format, however, proper documentation on the thoughts and creative process is required. This might however be informal and brief.

## Interactive Media
### Code
- Source code has to be published on GitHub or equivalent repository
- Code has to be commented

### Documentation
- Documentation of the project in form of a pdf is mandatory. It can be more text-based or more slides-like, however it must explain the rational, design principles, and in particular refer to all sources used.
- The documentation should enable the installation and application of the project.

## Talks and presentations
- 10 to 20 minutes long
- Followed by questions and discussion
- Can use any form of presentation technique (any form of media)
- Documentation and material is shared with the class afterwards

## Politics and Code: Criticism of Technology

> "Be conservative in what you do. Be liberal in what you accept from others."<sup>[Postel 1980](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc761#section-2.10)</sup>  
> It may seem strange that such a philosophical, perhaps even spiritual, principle should be embedded in the articulation of the Internet, but then network design, like all design, can be understood as ideology embodied, and the Internet clearly bore the stamp of the opposition to bigness characteristic of the era. Not long thereafter, three professors of computer science, David Reed, David Clark, and Jerome Saltzer, would try to explain what made the Internet so distinctive and powerful. In a seminal paper of 1984, “End-to-End Arguments in System Design,” they argued for the enormous potential inherent in decentralizing decisional authority—giving it to the network users (the “ends”). The network itself (the “middle”) should, they insisted, be as nonspecialized as possible, so as to serve the “ends” in any ways they could imagine. What were such notions if not the computer science version of what Hayek and Jacobs, Kohr and Schumacher, had been arguing. While we cannot say exactly that the network pioneers of the 1970s were disciples of these or any particular thinker, there is no denying the general climate of thought in which computer scientists were living, along with everybody else. Coming of age concurrently with an ideological backlash against centralized planning and authority, the Internet became a creature of its times.

# Final Project

### Interactive Media
The final project is a work of Interactive Media. You express your own view on politics and code. You can program an application, make a website, design a graphic novel, or make a video - you may just use any of IM's methods.

The goal is to show the project to the public (sort of) at the IM show case.

### Writing and Documentation
- In an essay you describe your project: The idea, the process of finding it, designing and developing the project, its technical as well as aesthetic considerations. The concept should be discussed from the perspective of critique: What do you want to achieve? Why is this important to you and why do you think it is meaningful to others?
- In the last class you give a presentation of your project which we will discuss.

### Group work
- Working in groups is highly recommended. Grades for group submissions will be equally assigned.

## Guidelines
- Project can be presented in public.
- All code is commented.
- Essay is c. 3,000 to 6,000 characters and follows the [guidelines](https://github.com/jbenno/nyuad_politics_of_code/wiki/Guidelines).
- Presentation is 5 to 7 slides (or equivalent), c. 5 to 10 minutes.
- Code, designs, images, texts, etc. is submitted via NYU Classes as documents or links to a repository.
